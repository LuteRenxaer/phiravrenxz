> The latest release is v1.3.15fix (2026-08-23) and predates the multiplayer and first-run work — rooms and online play currently only exist in the source tree. See [Differences from Phira](changes/index.md) for the full list.

## Multiplayer {#multiplayer}

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Game server | frp-bid.com:19936 |
| Web API | 110.42.63.208:31206 |
| Port rule | web port = game port + 1 |

Room list: <http://110.42.63.208:31206/api/rooms>

1. Open the game and click **Multiplayer** in the main menu.
2. Enter the server address (the official one is pre-filled) and connect.
3. Create a room or join one from the public room list. Room IDs allow up to 20 letters, digits, <code>-</code> and <code>_</code>.
4. The host picks a chart, everyone readies up and the host starts. When a match ends you go straight back to the room for another one.

To self-host, run <code>phira-mp-server</code> and point the client at your own address. The admin HTTP / WebSocket service runs on game port + 1 (<code>/api/*</code> and <code>/ws</code>).

## FAQ {#faq}

<details class="pv-faq" open>
  <summary>What happens to my old data after upgrading?</summary>
  <div class="pv-faq-body">

On startup the game looks for an old PhirLie / Phira-Vrenxz <code>data</code> folder and asks whether to sync it. Your current <code>data.json</code> is backed up first, the old data is merged in, and you are asked to restart.

The prompt appears once; afterwards use **Settings → Storage → Sync legacy data**.

<details class="pv-faq">
  <summary>Do I have to set everything up again after an update?</summary>
  <div class="pv-faq-body">

The first launch runs a wizard: language, sign-in, volume, other settings, then a final confirmation that also asks whether you want to play the tutorial. Returning players (data that already has a chosen language) do not see it again, and every setting can be changed later in the settings screen.
